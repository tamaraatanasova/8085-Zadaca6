# 8085 exercise no.6

After clearing data with value 09h from isolated
port with address 0Bh starting from address POCET, serial with
speed of 1200bps, 255 data are transferred. After
the transmission of data, on an output isolated port of
address 0Ah data 0Ch is transmitted. To write
assembly program based on ÂµP 8085. The frequency of
the oscillator is 4MHz.
